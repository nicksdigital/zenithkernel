# 🧮 SystemManager.ts – ZenithCore System Module Manual

## 🔍 Overview

`SystemManager.ts` is responsible for dynamically loading, instantiating, and coordinating all ECS-based systems in the ZenithCore runtime. It acts as the central orchestrator that maintains lifecycle, priority, and scheduling metadata for registered systems.

It plays a pivotal role in modular bootstrapping, system swapping, live diagnostics, and kernel hot-reloading.

---

## 🎯 Responsibilities

- Register/unregister ECS systems
- Delegate to the `Scheduler` for execution flow
- Track system lifecycle hooks
- Support dynamic and conditional loading (via WASM, OST, or manifest)

---

## 🧠 Core Interfaces

### `register(system: BaseSystem)`
- Initializes and wires a system into the ECS world context
- Automatically assigns it to the appropriate execution lane

### `unregister(system: BaseSystem)`
- Cleans up system bindings, removes from scheduler and world
- Invokes teardown if defined

### `getSystem(id: string): BaseSystem`
- Returns a system instance by its internal ID or type

---

## 🔧 Bootstrapping Flow

Used inside `ZenithKernel.ts` like:

```ts
systemManager.register(new TrustOracleSystem());
systemManager.register(new QuantumVectorSystem());
```

- Systems are often registered during the `bootstrapKernel` sequence
- Supports both core and plugin-based systems

---

## 🔍 Diagnostics & Extension

- Can be enhanced to support system hot-swapping
- Future support: WASM-backed systems with remote registration
- Potential to expose `/debug/systems` WebSocket view

Would you like me to proceed with `EntityBackedSystem.ts` next?
