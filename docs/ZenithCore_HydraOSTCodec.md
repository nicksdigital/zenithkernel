# 📦 HydraOSTCodec.ts – ZenithCore OST Compression Codec Manual

## 🔍 Overview

`HydraOSTCodec.ts` implements the custom encoding and decoding logic used to compress Hydra component bundles for decentralized distribution via the OST format. It applies stream-safe, WASM-ready compression techniques suitable for trusted runtime hydration.

---

## 🎯 Responsibilities

- Encode Hydra manifests and component payloads into OST-compatible bundles
- Decode and validate OST bundle input for hydration or verification
- Support fingerprinting, segment verification, and compression metrics

---

## 🧠 Key Methods

### `encodeHydraBundle(manifest, entryFile)`
Compresses manifest + entry file into an OST stream format with embedded hash metadata.

### `decodeHydraBundle(buffer)`
Reads and verifies the structure of a given buffer to extract manifest and component payload.

### `verifyHydraOST(buffer)`
Ensures bundle matches expected OST spec and optionally rehashes to verify integrity.

---

## 🔐 OST Format

Includes:
- Segment headers (manifest, entry, deps)
- Integrity hashes (SHA256 or ZK-hashed)
- Optional zk snapshot tag

---

## 🔗 Used In

- `WasmLoader.ts`
- `DistributedModuleLoader.ts`
- `ManifestAuth.ts` during zk and trust recovery
