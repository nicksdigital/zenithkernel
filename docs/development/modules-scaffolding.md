ssential & Highly Desirable Modules for Scaffolding / Pre-Launch
These modules would provide a robust foundation for developers, ensuring productivity and best practices from the get-go.

‚öôÔ∏è 1. Core Framework & Rendering Engine
@framework/core:
JSX Runtime & Compiler: The engine that understands and processes JSX, transforming it into efficient JavaScript and HTML.
Islands Hydration Logic: The client-side JavaScript responsible for hydrating islands efficiently (as discussed: predictive, selective, minimal).
Component Model: Base classes, types, or functions for defining components and islands.
Hook System (if applicable): If the framework uses a React-like hooks paradigm for state and lifecycle within islands.
Static Site Generation (SSG) & Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Primitives: Core utilities for rendering pages/islands on the server or at build time.
üõ£Ô∏è 2. Routing
@framework/router:
File-System Based Routing (Optional but common): Conventions for defining routes based on directory structure.
Programmatic Routing API: For dynamic routes, redirects, and navigation.
Nested Layouts: Support for defining layouts that apply to groups of routes.
Route Guards/Middleware: For authentication, authorization, or data pre-loading.
Type-Safe Route Parameters & Links: Leveraging TypeScript to ensure correctness when defining and linking to routes.
üóÑÔ∏è 3. State Management
@framework/state (or integrated into @framework/core):
Island-Scoped State: Simple, efficient primitives for managing state within individual interactive islands (e.g., lightweight observables, signals, or hooks).
Cross-Island Communication Primitives: Well-defined, type-safe mechanisms for islands to share state or send messages (e.g., custom events, shared workers with type-safe wrappers, or a minimal global store opt-in).
Server-to-Client State Serialization/Deserialization: Helpers to easily pass initial state from SSR/SSG to client-side islands.
üì° 4. Data Fetching & API Interaction
@framework/fetch (or @framework/data):
Type-Safe Fetch Wrappers: Utilities built around fetch that integrate with TypeScript for request and response typing.
Server Functions/API Route Handlers: A way to define backend API endpoints or server-side data fetching functions that can be easily called from the frontend with type safety.
Caching & Deduping Utilities: Basic, configurable caching mechanisms for API requests.
Mutation Helpers: Simplification for POST, PUT, DELETE operations and cache invalidation.
üõ†Ô∏è 5. Build & Development Tooling
@framework/cli:
Development Server: With Hot Module Replacement (HMR), fast refresh, and error overlays.
Build System: Optimized production builds (minification, tree-shaking, code-splitting per island).
Project Scaffolding: create-framework-app or similar to generate new projects with sensible defaults.
TypeScript Integration: Pre-configured tsconfig.json and build pipeline support.
Linters & Formatters Setup: Easy integration or built-in support for ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint, with framework-specific rules.
üß™ 6. Testing Utilities
@framework/testing:
Component/Island Rendering Utilities: Helpers for testing individual islands or components in isolation (both server-rendered output and client-side interactivity).
Mocking Utilities: For mocking API calls, modules, or framework internals.
Integration with Popular Test Runners: Easy setup for Jest, Vitest, Playwright, or Cypress.
End-to-End Testing Guidance/Setup: Recommended practices or basic configuration for E2E tests.
üé® 7. Styling Solutions (Flexible Integration)
While the core might be unopinionated, scaffolding should offer easy setup for:
CSS Modules: For locally scoped CSS.
Tailwind CSS Integration: A popular choice, so a streamlined setup would be beneficial.
CSS-in-JS Libraries (Optional): If popular, provide guidance or light wrappers for type-safe styling if it aligns with the framework's philosophy.
Global CSS Management: Clear way to include global styles and resets.
üåê 8. Internationalization (i18n)
@framework/i18n:
Message Loading & Management: Utilities for loading translation files (e.g., JSON).
Type-Safe Translation Functions/Components: t('greeting') or <Trans id="greeting" /> with key checking.
Locale Detection & Switching: Basic support for managing active locales.
Integration with Pluralization & Formatting Libraries.
‚ú® 9. Developer Experience & Utilities
@framework/dev-tools (Browser Extension or integrated):
Inspect island boundaries, hydration status, component hierarchy, and state.
@framework/meta (or similar for SEO):
Helpers for managing <head> tags (title, meta descriptions, canonical URLs, OpenGraph tags) in a type-safe way, per-page.
üîí 10. Security Primitives (Potentially part of @framework/core or a dedicated module)
@framework/security:
Utilities for sanitizing user input if not implicitly handled by JSX.
Guidance or helpers for setting up Content Security Policy (CSP).
CSRF protection mechanisms for form submissions if server functions are a core part.
Approach for "Accessible Before Launch":

Core modules (@framework/core, @framework/router, @framework/cli) must be solid and well-documented. These are the backbone.
Key utility modules like data fetching, basic state management, and testing utilities should be functional and available.
Integrations (like styling, advanced i18n) can have initial support or clear documentation for how to integrate popular third-party solutions.
The create-framework-app (or equivalent CLI command) should provide a working project with the most critical modules pre-configured.
The goal is to provide a comprehensive but not overwhelming starting point. Developers should feel empowered and productive immediately, with clear paths to add more specialized functionality as needed. Over-bundling everything into the core is undesirable; a modular approach where developers can opt-in is generally better.
