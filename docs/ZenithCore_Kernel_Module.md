# 🧠 ZenithKernel.ts – Core Runtime Entrypoint Manual

## 🔍 Overview

`ZenithKernel.ts` is the primary bootstrapping and lifecycle management engine of the ZenithCore framework. It initializes all runtime subsystems including the ECS, Scheduler, SystemManager, Messaging, and WASM loaders.

This file acts as the canonical root of the kernel and governs runtime composition, context propagation, hot-reloading, and quantum-safe system binding.

---

## 🎯 Responsibilities

- Boot and configure ECS state
- Register all system modules
- Initialize Hydra components, ZK stack, networking layer
- Hook kernel update loop (tick/frame/interval mode)
- Provide introspection and diagnostic surface

---

## 🧠 Key Methods

### `bootstrapKernel()`
Main initializer. Loads config, sets up systems, hydrates WASM if enabled.

### `startKernelLoop()`
Hooks into browser or service tick loop. Dispatches to `scheduler.run()` every frame.

### `resetKernel()`
Tears down systems, clears state, resets ECS.

## 🧩 Boot Process

```ts
await bootstrapKernel();
startKernelLoop();
```

1. Loads ECS + Scheduler
2. Registers core systems (TrustOracle, MessagingSystem, etc.)
3. Binds Hydras to DOM/render pipelines
4. Optionally validates WASM module manifests
5. Begins tick loop with deterministic delta

## 🔗 Kernel Integration

- Scheduler: tick loop dispatcher
- ECSManager: global data store
- SystemManager: runtime system registry
- WASMProxy: execution enclave for edge modules

---

## 📐 Design Philosophy

- Modular microkernel design
- Hot-swappable systems
- ZKP-first security model
- Declarative ECS lifecycle

ZenithKernel is the orchestrator. Everything flows through it.
