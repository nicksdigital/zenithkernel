# 🗜️ OSTCompression.ts – ZenithCore Compression Layer Manual

## 🔍 Overview

`OSTCompression.ts` implements the core compression utilities used in the OST  protocol within ZenithCore. It handles stream optimization, segment merging, and fingerprint hashing for efficient component transport across distributed systems.

---

## 🎯 Responsibilities

- Compress raw Hydra or WASM bundles into OST format
- Encode segment headers and boundaries
- Apply fingerprinting for verification and fast cache lookups
- Optionally support parallel segment encoding

---

## 🧠 Key Methods

### `compress(data: Buffer, options: OSTOptions): Buffer`
Compresses data into OST format using default or custom compression levels.

### `decompress(buffer: Buffer): DecodedOST`
Parses an OST buffer and reconstructs its original structure (header + segments).

### `hashSegment(segment): string`
Generates a cryptographic hash (SHA256 or zk-hash) for bundle verification.

---

## 🔩 OST Structure

- `Header`: Metadata, version, compression type
- `Segments`: Manifest, entry file, dependency graph
- `Footer`: Hash map and signature

---

## 🔗 Used In

- `HydraOSTCodec.ts`
- `ParallelOSTCompressor.ts`
- CLI tooling: `create-hydra`, `sign-manifest`, `publish-module`
