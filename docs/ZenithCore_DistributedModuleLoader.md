# 🌐 DistributedModuleLoader.ts – ZenithCore Network Utility Manual

## 🔍 Overview

`DistributedModuleLoader.ts` enables decentralized discovery and retrieval of system or component manifests and bundles over the ZenithCore network. It acts as a bridge between qDHT, OST registries, and local caches to hydrate and validate runtime modules dynamically.

---

## 🎯 Responsibilities

- Discover manifest or module metadata via qDHT
- Fetch and validate bundles from distributed stores
- Support fallback to signed OST or cache layers
- Enable offline-first rehydration for trusted components

---

## 🧠 Core Methods

### `fetchFromRegistry(id: string): Manifest | null`
Looks up a manifest by ID using gossip/qDHT + OST.

### `resolveAndLoad(id: string): Module | null`
Loads the full module (e.g., WASM or Hydra component) from resolved manifest.

### `isValid(manifest: Manifest): boolean`
Checks signature, format, and optionally zk claims before execution.

---

## 🔧 Capabilities

- Live rehydration of UI or logic bundles
- Registry fallback hierarchy: cache → OST → qDHT
- Auto-verification using `ManifestAuth` and zk snapshot metadata

---

## 🔐 Security

- Verifies manifest OST signatures
- May hash match against zk snapshot
- Local cache keyed by signed hash fingerprint

---

## 🔗 Used By

- `HydraLoader.tsx`
- `WasmLoader.ts`
- Admin dashboards (optional real-time trace)

Shall I continue with `ManifestGenerator.ts` next?
