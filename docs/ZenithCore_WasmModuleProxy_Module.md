# 🧬 WasmModuleProxy.ts – ZenithCore Runtime Module Manual

## 🔍 Overview

`WasmModuleProxy.ts` handles secure, isolated execution of WebAssembly modules within the ZenithCore microkernel environment. It acts as a runtime bridge between WASM bundles (typically Hydra components or systems) and the ECS/event loop.

It provides lifecycle management, state access, host bindings, and ZKP integration where applicable.

---

## 🎯 Responsibilities

- Instantiate and manage WASM modules safely
- Provide WASI-like interface for memory and I/O
- Bridge ECS data/state access to WASM-bound functions
- Enforce ZK attestation prior to module registration
- Enable hot-swapping and memory sandbox enforcement

---

## 🧠 Core Methods

### `loadWasmModule(manifest: Manifest)`
- Loads a WASM file referenced in the manifest
- Verifies OST signature and ZKP hash if required

### `invoke(fn: string, ...args)`
- Invokes a function exported by the WASM module with runtime context

### `bindHostInterface()`
- Maps ECS operations and trusted functions into the WASM runtime
- Allows WASM to call host functions (e.g., log, trustUpdate, broadcast)

---

## 🔒 Security

- ZKP hash check ensures tamper-proofed WASM
- Only OST-signed modules can be registered
- Memory access sandboxed per module
- Runtime invocation limited to predefined exports

---

## 🔗 Integration Targets

- Hydras rendered in WASM (via `execType: 'edge'`)
- Quantum computation modules
- Runtime simulation / dev harness
- Trusted execution of plug-and-play consensus or game logic

Shall I finish with `ZenithKernel.ts` next?
