# ✅ VerifySystem.ts – ZenithCore ZK Verifier Module Manual

## 🔍 Overview

`VerifySystem.ts` is responsible for verifying zero-knowledge proofs (zkProofs) associated with Hydra components, registry identities, and system authentication events. It performs both inline proof checks and triggers external verifier circuits if configured.

This module is key for enforcing trust boundaries across distributed runtime logic in ZenithCore.

---

## 🎯 Responsibilities

- Accept proof verification requests from kernel modules or Hydra lifecycles
- Check zkProofs against the QZKP verifier
- Emit verification status into ECS or trust registries
- Manage verifier configuration, versions, and cache

---

## 🧠 Core Methods

### `verifyProof(entityId, zkProof)`
Checks proof validity for the specified peer or component. Returns boolean result.

### `getVerifier(circuit: string)`
Returns the verifier implementation or endpoint for the specified zk circuit.

### `cacheResult(hash, outcome)`
Stores pass/fail results to avoid re-verification within short timeframes.

---

## 🔗 Use Cases

- `HydraLoader.tsx` → verifies `zkProof` before hydration
- `RegistryServer.ts` → validates identity claims
- `ChallengeSystem.ts` → binds response verification to on-chain/off-chain circuits
- ZK role-based access control and gating

---

## 🔒 Verifier Types

- Local WASM verifier (in-kernel)
- zkVM-based verifier (offloaded)
- Remote QZKP proof broker (e.g., zkRollup node)
- Precompiled Rust ZK validator

That wraps the registry module batch. Would you like to proceed with the decorators or adapter layer next?
