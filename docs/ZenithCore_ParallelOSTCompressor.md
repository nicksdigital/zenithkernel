# 🧪 ParallelOSTCompressor.ts – ZenithCore High-Performance OST Utility Manual

## 🔍 Overview

`ParallelOSTCompressor.ts` is a high-throughput encoder that compresses OST segments in parallel threads or worker pools to optimize bundle creation performance. It's especially useful for large WASM modules, Hydra trees, or layered dependency graphs.

---

## 🎯 Responsibilities

- Compress OST segments in parallel
- Maintain deterministic segment boundaries
- Reorder and merge results post-processing
- Support progressive hash computation for long bundles

---

## 🧠 Core Functions

### `compressSegmentsConcurrently(files: Buffer[]): Promise<OSTSegment[]>`
Splits files across workers and returns compressed segments with hashes.

### `mergeSegments(segments: OSTSegment[]): Buffer`
Concatenates compressed segments into a valid OST payload with footer map.

### `profileCompression(stream: Buffer[])`
Returns performance metrics like:
- compression ratio
- duration per segment
- segment entropy

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Uses `WorkerPool` or thread streams
- Skips recompression for identical segments
- Pre-filters no-op deltas if hashes match (OST-level deduplication)

---

## 🔗 Use Cases

- OST pack creation during CI or CLI
- Dev mode with large assets (WASM, UI graphs)
- HydraShards or multi-layer zk bundles
